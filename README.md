- 👋 Hi, I’m @AxMeNi
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, trains, fun, music, dance, climbing, hiking... 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning geology, mathematics, AI, physics, how to cook a carrot-cake that doesn't taste like carrot, the ways to say "I need a spoon" in all languages, how to bankrupt my bank, the way I'm gonna die.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a better future.
- 📫 How to reach me : you dont, privacy wins.
- 😄 Pronouns: their, you, that, this, it, her, his, yours, them, him, he, she, its, those, these (chose the one you want)
- ⚡ Fun fact: lol
